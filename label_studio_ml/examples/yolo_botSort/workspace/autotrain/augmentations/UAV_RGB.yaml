# --- Geometric augmentations ---
degrees: 20           # ↑ allow more rotation; gimbal footage often introduces roll/tilt
translate: 0.2        # ↑ increase translation; framing varies as drone pans
scale: 0.4            # smaller min scale for high-altitude; allows wider zoom changes
shear: 2.0            # small shear to simulate gimbal pitch/yaw distortion
perspective: 0.001    # slightly stronger than pure top-down; mimics tilt

# --- Flips ---
fliplr: 0.5           # horizontal flip more likely (drone yaw changes)
flipud: 0.2           # keep lower; vertical flips less realistic for oblique angles

# --- Photometric augmentations ---
hsv_h: 0.02           # slightly larger hue variation (sunlight, reflection)
hsv_s: 0.7            # keep strong saturation variation (weather/scene contrast)
hsv_v: 0.5            # ↑ brighter/dimmer variation due to angle of sunlight

# --- Advanced mix augmentations ---
mosaic: 1.0           # keep enabled; still very helpful for background diversity
mixup: 0.15           # slightly higher to help generalization with angle variation
copy_paste: 0.1       # still useful if available

# --- Additional useful options ---
crop_fraction: 0.0    # no cropping; oblique scenes rely on context for detection
