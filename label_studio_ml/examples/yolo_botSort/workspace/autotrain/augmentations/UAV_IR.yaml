# --- Geometric Augmentations ---
degrees: 10           # small gimbal tilt or roll
translate: 0.15       # simulate UAV drift or vibration
scale: 0.3            # slight zooms due to altitude changes
shear: 0.05           # mild shear for off-axis shots
perspective: 0.002    # small perspective warps for oblique angles
flipud: 0.0           # IR people upside-down unrealistic
fliplr: 0.5           # people can appear mirrored on turns

# --- Photometric (Intensity) Augmentations ---
hsv_h: 0.0            # IR has no hue
hsv_s: 0.0            # no saturation
hsv_v: 0.1            # slight brightness variation

# --- Structural ---
mosaic: 0.8           # helps simulate multi-scene context
mixup: 0.1            # low-level mixing for robustness
copy_paste: 0.0       # not useful for thermal imagery
